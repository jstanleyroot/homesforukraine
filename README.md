## About
											
1. This Workbook collects into a Combined data sheet, data published on this UK Gov website, of end-of-week totals for visas issued and arrivals under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.																			See here	
2. From the Combined data a Rolling report is generated showing the same data by week since May 10th,  the first data recorded after the start of the scheme																				
3. From the Rolling report a forecast is generated of numbers at risk of homelessness 6 months after their arrival if No Action is taken by UK government and local authorities to prevent homelessness																				
4. This No Action report applies two factors to the raw Rolling report data which are set out in the table above: likely homelessness % and cost per week of temporary accommodation.																				
5. A second Action report applies different factors assuming  effective action is taken to prevent homelessness, specifically, but not exclusively,  a proactive rematching campaign.																				
6. The Reporting sheet compares No Action to Action results, showing potential savings in terms of people and costs of an effective Action campaign week by week for the next 6 months																				
7. The reporting box shows, at local authority and country level, how many people could be saved from homelessness and how much cash could be saved after  6 months by an effective Action campaign
